    <h1>The Characteristics of a Profession</h1>
    
    <h2>EXPERT KNOWLEDGE</h2>
    <p class="pragraph">  
        Expert knowledge is special technical knowledge that is certified by some authority and is not possessed by the layperson.<br>
         George Bernard Shaw once said that every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.<br>
          Expert knowledge is related to skill, which may be learned “on the job.” <br>
         Indeed, in earlier times some professions were learned in an apprenticeship manner. Would-be lawyers
          “read law” in law offices and would-be physicians went along on house calls with doctors and assisted them in their practices.<br> 
          The practice of going on “hospital rounds” is still a part of medical education today.
    </p>

    <h2>AUTONOMY</h2>
    <p class="pragraph">
        Autonomy involves independence in conducting one’s professional practice in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up – to use the language of the medical profession.<br>
        Diagnosis deals with finding the root of the problem that needs to be treated.<br>
        Treatment involves discovering what should be done to alleviate the problem.<br> 
        Follow-up is concerned with evaluation, that is, checking to see if the treatment was effective.
    </p>

    <h2>INTERNAL GOVERNANCE</h2>
    <p class="pragraph">
        Internal governance means that one’s professional field is controlled by its practitioners rather than by some external authority.<br>
        It includes the setting of entrance requirements and the handling of the discipline of one’s errant colleagues.
    </p>

    <h2>Service to Society</h2>
    <p class="pragraph">
        Historically, service to society has involved some kind of humanitarian service, <br>
        for example, spiritual ministration, the curing of illness, or the defense of the wrongly accused
