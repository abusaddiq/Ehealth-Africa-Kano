            <b>Software engineering : </b> is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of
            software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining
            the system after it has gone into use.<br>

           <br> <strong> In this definition, there are two key phrases:</strong><br>

        <ol>
            <li> Engineering discipline Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods,
                and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively and always try to discover
                solutions
                to problems even when there are no applicable
                theories and methods. Engineers also recognize that they must work to
                organizational and financial constraints so they look for solutions within these
                constraints.
            </li><br>
            <li> All aspects of software production Software engineering is not just concerned
                with the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities
                such as software project management and the development of tools, methods,
                and theories to support software production.
            </li>

        </ol>

        Engineering is about getting results of the required quality within the schedule
        and budget. This often involves making compromises—engineers cannot be perfectionists.
        People writing programs for themselves, however, can spend as much time
        as they wish on the program development.<br>
        In general, software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their
        work, as this is often the most effective way to produce high-quality software.
        However, engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for a set of
        circumstances so a more creative, less formal approach to development may be
        effective in some circumstances. Less formal development is particularly appropriate
        for the development of web-based systems, which requires a blend of software
        and graphical design skills.

        <h3 id="Pro_software"> Professional Software Development </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Professional software development</b>
            Lots of people write programs. People in business write spreadsheet programs to
            simplify their jobs, scientists and engineers write programs to process their experimental
            data, and hobbyists write programs for their own interest and enjoyment.
            However, the vast majority of software development is a professional activity where
            software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices,
            or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional
            software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed
            by teams rather than individuals. It is maintained and changed throughout its life.
           
            <br><br> Software engineering is intended to support professional software development,
            rather than individual programming. It includes techniques that support program : 
            <b>specification, design, and evolution,</b> none of which are normally relevant for personal
            software development. To help you to get a broad view of what software engineering
            is about,Many people think that software is simply another word for computer programs.<br>

            <br>However, when we are talking about software engineering, 
            <b>software is not just the programs themselves but also all associated documentation and configuration data
            that is required to make these programs operate correctly.</b> <em> A professionally developed
            software system is often more than a single program.</em> The system usually consists
            of a number of separate programs and configuration files that are used to set up
            these programs. It may include system documentation, which describes the structure
            of the system; user documentation, which explains how to use the system, and websites
            for users to download recent product information.<br>
            <strong> This is one of the important differences between professional and amateur software
            development.</strong> If you are writing a program for yourself, no one else will use it
            and you don’t have to worry about writing program guides, documenting the program
            design, etc. However, if you are writing software that other people will use and
            other engineers will change then you usually have to provide additional information
            as well as the code of the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="important"> Important of Software Engineering </h3>

        <p>
            <b>Software engineering is important for two reasons:</b>

            <ol>

            <li> More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We
            need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and
            quickly.</li><br>

            <li> It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and
            techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a
            personal programming project. For most types of systems, the majority of costs
            are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            The systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes called
            a <b> Software process.</b> <em>A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the
            production of a software product.</em><br>

            <br><b> There are four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes. These activities are:</b>

            <ul>
            <li> Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that
            is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.</li><br>
            <li> Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.</li><br>
            <li> Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the
            customer requires.</li><br>
            <li> Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer
            and market requirements.</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 id="general">General Issues that Affect Software Engineering </h3>
        Software engineering method or technique that is applicable for all of these.
        However, there are three general issues that affect many different types of software:
        1. Heterogeneity Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems
        across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. As
        well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also have to execute
        on mobile phones. You often have to integrate new software with older legacy systems
        written in different programming languages. The challenge here is to develop
        techniques for building dependable software that is flexible enough to cope with
        this heterogeneity.
        2. Business and social change Business and society are changing incredibly quickly
        as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They
        need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software.
        Many traditional software engineering techniques are time consuming and
        delivery of new systems often takes longer than planned. They need to evolve so
        that the time required for software to deliver value to its customers is reduced.
        3. Security and trust As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is
        essential that we can trust that software. This is especially true for remote software
        systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to
        make sure that malicious users cannot attack our software and that information
        security is maintained.
