        <center><b> DANGER OF GRADUATES THAT DON'T THINK BEYOND THEIR CERTIFICATES </b></center>
    </h1>
    <p>
        <em>“Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school. It is a miracle that
            curiosity survives formal education”</em> — <strong> Einstein </strong>
        <br>The greatest form of disability in life is not knowing your ability. Your winning edge in life is not the
        degree you have acquired or the certificate you possessed, but your ability to solve problems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whenever I interview graduates, I am not so keen on their qualifications; <strong> am only keen on their special
            skills</strong>, experiences and their unique approach to problem-solving. <b>Most of them cannot even apply
            the knowledge they have acquired in school to solving life problems</b>. <strong> 21st Century employer
            doesn’t necessarily pay you a salary for the certificate you possess, but for the problems you can
            solve</strong>.
        <br>The reality of life is that there are more employable graduates than the available jobs, and it is only
        graduates that can actually think beyond their certificate that would eventually find their own place in life.
        Mark Twain said: *“Don’t let schooling interfere with your education.” The proof of going to school is your
        certificate, but the proof of your education is in your ability to solve problems through innovation and
        creativity.*
    </p>
    <p>
        *Graduates that cannot solve problems are liabilities. <em>Education is not just about going to school and
            getting a degree;</em> it is about widening your knowledge, thinking creatively and absorbing the truth
        about life. <strong> must see our education beyond our certificates.</strong> Many people spend their precious
        years in school only to end up acquiring certificate, not education.
        <b>Einstein said:</b> <em>“Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.”</em>
        Have you ever heard of the creativity term, <em>‘think outside the box?’.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the major reasons why most graduates are poor is because <b>they cannot see and think beyond their
            certificates.</b>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> I have seen engineering graduates work as bankers.</strong></li>
        <li> <strong> I have seen medical doctors with great skills in web and graphic designs. </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> I have seen lawyers that are very dexterous with finances. The list is endless! </strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The basic truth of life is that the skills needed to be much sought after and become more successful in life are
        not really found within the walls of the classrooms.
        <br> Your certificate is just proof that you are teachable; it does not suggest what you are totally capable of
        doing. <strong>You are full of possibilities when you think beyond your degrees and certificates.</strong>
