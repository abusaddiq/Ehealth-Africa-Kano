    <h1>Software Engineer</h1>

    <h2 id="h21">Software engineering is a systematic approach to the production of software that
        takes into account practical cost, schedule, and dependability issues, as well as the
        needs of software customers and producers.</h2>

    <h2 style="color: chartreuse;"> Difference between Software Engineering and Computer Sciences and System Engineering</h2>
    
    <p class="dif">
         <b>Computer science</b> focuses on <em> theory and
        fundamentals;</em> <b>Software engineering</b> is concerned
        with the <em> practicalities </em> of developing and delivering
        useful software.</p>

    <p class="dif">
        <b> System engineering </b>is concerned with all aspects of
        computer-based systems development including
        <em> hardware, software, and process engineering.</em> <b> Software
        engineering</b> is part of this more general process.
    </p>

    <h2 id="h22">fundamental activities that are common
        to all software processes.</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong> Software specification :</strong> where customers and engineers define the software that
            is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.</li>

        <li><strong> Software development :</strong> where the software is designed and programmed.</li>

        <li><strong> Software validation :</strong> where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the
            customer requires.</li>

        <li><strong> Software evolution :</strong> where the software is modified to reflect changing customer
            and market requirements.</li>
