    Students take formal courses in professional ethics in a number of professional programs in their respective colleges.  
    Without  taking  formal  courses  in  their  curriculum,  students  are  taught  a  good amount  of  the  information  ethics  sprinkled  throughout  their  courses,  either  in general education or in their major.

<div class="div2"> Many professions, in order to keep members updated and compliant with their codes, limit the validity of their licenses to specific time periods so members have to renew their licenses. They then tie license renewal to passing of continuing examinations, which helps ensure that members stay knowledgeable in the profession.
