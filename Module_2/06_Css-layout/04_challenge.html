        Many professions, in order to keep members updated and compliant with their codes, limit the validity of their licenses to specific time periods so members have to renew their licenses. 
        They then tie license renewal to passing of continuing examinations, which helps ensure that members stay knowledgeable in the profession. 
        Professions  also  use  periodic  licensing  examinations  to  check  on  membersâ€™ compliance  with  codes. 
        If  members  have  in  the  past  violated  a  code  and  been reported, such members may not have their licenses renewed even if they pass all examinations.
