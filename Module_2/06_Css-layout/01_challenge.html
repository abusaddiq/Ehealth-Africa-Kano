<div id="overflowTest">
    As students go through high school, content should become progressively more sophisticated.<br><br>  
    The  message  on  responsible  use  of  computers  should  be  stressed more.<br><br> 
    The teen years are years of curiosity and discovery, and a lot of young people  find themselves spending long hours on computers and other online devices.<br><br> 
    Those long hours should be spent responsibly. While a good portion of the message should come  from  parents,  schools  should  also  be  part  of  this  partnership  by  offering courses  in  responsible  use  of  computers.<br><br>  
    The  teaching  could  focus  on  ethics; students  should  be  given  reasons  why  they  cannot  create  and  distribute  viruses, download copyrighted materials off the Internet, and use the Internet to send bad messages to others.<br><br> 
    These are ethical reasons that go beyond “do it and you will be expelled from school” type of threats.
